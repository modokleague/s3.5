# **MODOK LEAGUE SEASON 3.5 - KREE PRECON PARTY**

MODOK League Season 3.5 is a one-round off-season event between Seasons 3 and 4. It features print-and-play content and experimental deck-building restrictions.

Each kouple drafts two heroes and uses modified precons to face Klaw with the Kree Fanatic modular set. You have up to one attempt at each of the scenario's six difficulty levels, but will earn points for only the highest difficulty-level you defeat.

# The Draft

Season 3.5 is a hero-only draft. Kouples will be sorted into divisions, with a maximum of 16 kouples per division. A preview of the draft-pool randomizer is available at [https://modokleague.github.io/s3.5/](https://modokleague.github.io/s3.5/)

All heroes up to and including Winter Soldier and Falcon are in the pool of eligible heroes, with the following exceptions:

- **Banned for Season 3.5:** Adam Warlock, Cable, Cyclops, Gamora and Maria Hill

The heroes are will all be placed into a single pool, with 15 more heroes than needed. Thus, a full division with 16 kouples (12 kouples × 2 heroes/kouple + 15 heroes) would have 47 heroes in the draft pool.

The draft will be asynchronous, with each kouple having 24 hours to make their pick after being informed that they are on the clock. The draft-bot (see the draft-pool randomizer) will be used to make the kouple's pick if no pick has been made after 24 hours.

Each kouple drafts one hero when it is their selection, with the draft following a snake order (i.e., A, B, C, C, B, A).

# Deck-building

For each hero, deck-building starts with that hero's precon and the following rules:

- You must keep at least one copy of each deck-building card from the original precon. You may replace any extra copies or add additional cards to create a deck of 40-50 cards, using standard deck-building rules. See the Hulk example below.
- Regular uniqueness rules apply during play. For example, if your two heroes both have a Quincarrier in their precons, only one hero can have theirs in play at any given time.
- You are not limited by any single-collection restrictions for card availability. For example, a single copy of the Beak ally was released only in the Ice-Man hero pack, but both Heroes would be allowed to include a copy of the Beak ally if the kouple chose to do so.

# Play Details

You are allowed to modify your decks and practice before and in-between attempts, but must declare before setup that a specific game will be your official attempt at that difficulty.

- Advance (Standard I)
